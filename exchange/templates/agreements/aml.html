            <h2>Anti Money Laundering (AML)</h2>
            <p>
                <h4>1. AML is tightly linked to Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, which essentially involve verifying customers' identities and the sources of their income. KYC also requires financial institutions to monitor their users' activity on an ongoing basis. Like AML, modern KYC procedures are heavily automated, and many institutions use the client onboarding process as an opportunity to acquire proper identification from new customers</h4>
                <h4>2. Many governmental institutions and pieces of legislation play roles in establishing AML requirements. In the US, agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) provide general information and resources for broker-dealers, and futures commission merchants to set AML standards</h4>
                <h4>3. Anti-money laundering (AML) is a broad term for laws and regulations put in place to prevent criminals from making money illegally or moving illicit funds. While many illegal activities are targeted by AML laws, some of the most important are tax evasion, public corruption, and market manipulation through methods such as wash trading</h4>
                <h4>4.  We may at any time modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any portion or feature of the CryptoExchange Services.  In particular, we may:  (1) refuse to complete or block, cancel, or, where permitted by Applicable Law, reverse any Transaction you have authorised; (2) terminate, suspend, or restrict your access to any or all of the CryptoExchange Services</h4>
                <h4>5. “Transaction” means selling, purchasing, or entering into (or agreeing to enter into) other transactions in Virtual Assets, their derivatives, other asset(s), or product(s) as CryptoExchange may from time to time make available on the Platform, and depositing or withdrawing Virtual Assets or Fiat Currency into or out of your CryptoExchange Account.</h4>
